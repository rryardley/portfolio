              <p>I developed this website based on a Photoshop Design Comp for my Responsive Website course. I coded both the HTML and CSS from scratch and included breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, so styles will adjust to the change in screen size.

              <p>This is a mock portfolio website that I created for a project in the Skillcrush program. I was given some starter code and an image of what the final product should look like. I filled in the gaps and used a Photoshop Design Comp to create the website you see here. I used Github to host the site, click the thumbnail to check it out!</p>

              <p>This was a fun project for my JavaScript course in Skillcrush. It incorporates jQuery components and combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript via the DOM. The final product is a Magic 8 Ball, where you can ask a yes or no question and get a random answer. It incorporates code from jQuery and jQueryUI libraries.

              <p>This was another project for my JavaScript course in Skillcrush. To complete this project, I combined my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The final product is a clock with drop downs where you can select what time you want different alarms to go off. Each time corresponds with a different LOLCat image. There is also a "Party Time" button that utilizes an event listener. I used Github to host the site, click the thumbnail to check it out!</p>

              <h4>Solving problems excites me.</h4>
              <p>I have always loved problem solving, from sudoku puzzles to physics problems, so web development was a natural path for me. Both my educational and professional backgrounds are in engineering (BS and MEng from Cornell University), and I am currently enrolled in Skillcrush's Technical Blueprint program to develop my coding skills. I am loving every minute of the program - I am a dedicated self-starter (doing this program while working as a design engineer full-time) and a fast-learner. I am a creative, out-of-the-box thinker with a high attention to detail and an eye for design. My favorite thing about web development is the combination of logic and design - being able to use both sides of my brain in one career is a dream come true! </p>
              <p>When I'm not seeking out more coding skills to learn, I love snuggling up with my family and binging our favorite shows, or venturing out to a local brewery for a pint! </p>
